  <p>My name is Nithya Charles and I study Creative Advertising at MSU. I went from making ads for my toys as a kid, to making commercials for class, and I hope to someday create unique and exciting content for clients. </p>
  <p>I draw inspiration from all aspects of my life (how can you not when sitcoms and ABBA exist?). I love to make others laugh and expand my skills as a designer and advertiser. My experience as an advertising student, as well as working in marketing and social media have taught me a lot about the IMC industry- but I’m excited to learn about all the advertising field has to offer.
</p>
  <p>Some people are adrenaline junkies- chasing the rush of excitement they feel after a stunt. I consider myself an idea junkie. To me, few things compare to the feeling of an original idea that you just KNOW works. I’m committed to chasing that feeling and becoming the best creative I can be.</p><br>
